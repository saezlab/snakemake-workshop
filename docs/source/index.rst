Welcome to the snakemake workshop tutorial
==========================================

In this workshop, we will try to go into more details about how to use snakemake in order to make your workflows easier to manage and more reproducible.
In particular we are going to take a look at how to start a new project, set up a snakemake working environment, and then go over the basics of snakemake.

`Snakemake's own tutorial <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html>`_ goes over the most important topics, but neglects some more advanced concepts like how to set up environments automatically, and how to setup and execute workflows on a SLURM cluster.
